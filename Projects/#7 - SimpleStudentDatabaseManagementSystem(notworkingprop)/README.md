# This is a simple student database management system developed in C++. implmented with txt file
* It utilizes file handling and shows effective implementation of class and object of the programming language. (was mixed with c and c++ concepts that don't 
work well together currenly... or rather are pretty old...)
** or at least it trys to this is a mix of c and c++ concepts and they don't mix well i was just trying to mess around with stuff 

* again this does not work properly so for the most part i'll try to fix it if i feel like it...
